Car Rental System Project Statement

Problem Statement

Current car rental processes often rely on manual tracking, leading to inefficiencies, double-bookings, and lack of real-time inventory visibility. This results in poor customer satisfaction, delayed service, and high administrative overhead for rental agencies. A digital system is needed to streamline these operations, manage the fleet effectively, and provide customers with quick, reliable service.

Scope of the Project

The scope of this project is to develop a functional Car Rental System application capable of managing the core rental lifecycle. This includes centralized management of the vehicle inventory and the tracking of active customer rentals. The system will primarily focus on terminal/console-based operation but will establish the logical foundation for future expansion into a web-based service.

Target Users

Customers (Renters): Individuals who need to view available cars, rent a vehicle, and return a vehicle.

Rental Agents/Staff: Employees responsible for processing rental transactions, checking car availability, and managing customer inquiries.

Administrators: Users who manage the overall car fleet, including adding new vehicles to the inventory.
