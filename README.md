Car Rental System🚗 Project OverviewThe Car Rental System is a console-based application designed to manage the inventory and rental operations of a small-scale car rental business. Built using Python, the system provides a simple, menu-driven interface for tracking vehicle availability, processing customer rentals and returns, and calculating associated costs.✨ FeaturesThe system is organized into modular classes (CarManager, RentalManager, UserInterface) and provides the following core functionalities:Car Inventory Management: Maintain a list of cars with unique IDs, make, model, and current availability status.Add New Cars: Administrative function to expand the vehicle fleet.View Available Cars: Display a filtered list of all vehicles ready for immediate rental.Rent Car Transaction: Process a new rental, checking availability, updating the car status, and recording the transaction.Cost Calculation: Automatically calculate the estimated rental cost based on the number of days and a fixed daily rate ($50).Return Car Transaction: Process a vehicle return, removing the rental record and marking the car as available in the inventory.View Active Rentals: List all ongoing rentals, showing the customer name, car ID, and rental duration.Robust Input Handling: Gracefully handles invalid or non-numeric input from the user.💻 Technologies/Tools UsedPrimary Language: Python 3.xStructure: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) methodology using three main classes (CarManager, RentalManager, UserInterface).Data Storage: In-memory Python dictionaries (data is volatile and resets upon application restart).🚀 Steps to Install & Run the ProjectSince this is a single, self-contained Python script, no installation dependencies are required beyond having Python installed on your system.Save the Code: Save the provided Python code into a file named car_rental_system.py.Open Terminal/Command Prompt: Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.Run the Application: Execute the script using the Python interpreter:python car_rental_system.py
Follow the Menu: The application will start and display the main menu. Enter the corresponding number (1-6) to interact with the system.🧪 Instructions for TestingFollow the menu options to test the system's core functionalities. The system starts with a pre-loaded inventory of 4 cars, where ID 3 ("Ford Mustang") is initially unavailable.Menu OptionTest ActionExpected Outcome1. View Available CarsSelect option 1.Should list Cars ID 1, 2, and 4.5. Add a New CarEnter Make: "Tesla", Model: "Model 3".A success message is printed, and the car is added with ID 5.2. Rent a Car (Successful)Customer: "Alice", Car ID: 1, Days: 3.Success message, Car ID 1 is marked unavailable, and cost ($150) is displayed.2. Rent a Car (Unavailable)Customer: "Bob", Car ID: 1.Error message stating the car is not available.4. View Active RentalsSelect option 4.Should show the rental record for "Alice".3.
